            There are many activities that I like to do to pass the time doing hobbies. When I have free time, I like to spend time on drawing. I really like drawing since I was little. For me, drawing is very fun because it is related to colors. It makes me interested in drawing. Of course, I prefer to draw and color on a canvas board because I will hang it on the wall.
            Next, a fun fact for me is that I am someone who likes to play chess. There are a lot of chess at home because I like to play. But among my six siblings, only one likes to play chess. During Form 2, I once joined a chess club. Not only that, I also like to play chess via phone or computer by downloading chess games.
