                My favourite hobby is taking pictures. I like to keep cameras to use as a camera collection and taking pictures.
                This hobby was inspired by my father, Abd Hamid, who has a variety of camera and video camera collections.
                Every time we go on vacation, he will record us. So, when the time comes, we can see the memories that we have made.

            My family and I love raising fish, and we have several aquariums and a fish pond at home. I cherish the memory of my fish named Se, which I raised for three years.
            Unfortunately, I cannot raise furry animals due to eczema, but I find joy in taking care of aquatic pets like fish and turtles.
            Ada cerita disebalik nama "Se", dimana saya menamakan se bagi menunjukkan seekor jadi memudahkan saya untuk menamakan ikan saya dengan Se.
            This is the longest fish I have kept. The routine I always do is every 2 weeks, I will clean the aquarium.
            Feed every morning and night.I was very sad when I found out he was gone because this fish was very special to me.

                In my free time, my favorite activity is cycling. I really enjoy cycling because riding a bike increases my stamina. Cycling allows me to explore 
                the green surroundings and the beauty of nature. The place I often cycle is in Putrajaya, which has less traffic compared to Kuala Lumpur, and the flora there is well-maintained.

            Travel is what I like the most. This travel allows us to learn to get to know the culture regardless of whether it is in Malaysia or outside Malaysia.
            An experience that I will never forget is traveling with my partner and going out with my family. A very beautiful memory! From the experience
            this makes me excited to travel within Malaysia and outside Malaysia to explore the beauty of flora and fauna on this earth.
            Among the foreign countries I've been to is traveling in Indonesia. I can feel how the roads are congested on the highway
            Indonesia. Very compact! Unique culture, beautiful shopping places and very tasty food. I like nasi padang
            Indonesia. Then, Universal Studio Singapore. I was able to play various theme parks there. It was very best and amazing!.

                Chess is an activity that is also my hobby. When I was a child I always played with my father and uncle.
                I used to join a chess club because I like playing chess. By joining this chess club
                I can master the skill of playing chess.

        Next, watching a movie is one of my favourite hobbies. Watching movies is my favorite fav. It's not just me who is interested but all members
        My family is also interested in watching movies. The genre I am interested in is thriller, fantasy, action, adventure, science fiction and many more.
        Watching movies allows us as a family to spend time together and strengthen our friendship. Among the movies I am interested in are:
        The moon, the maze runner, harry potter, beauty and the beast and more.
