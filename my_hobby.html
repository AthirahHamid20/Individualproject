                My favourite hobby is taking pictures. I like to keep cameras to use as a camera collection and taking pictures.
                This hobby was inspired by my father, Abd Hamid, who has a variety of camera and video camera collections.
                Every time we go on vacation, he will record us. So, when the time comes, we can see the memories that we have made.

            My family and I love raising fish, and we have several aquariums and a fish pond at home. I cherish the memory of my fish named Se, which I raised for three years.
            Unfortunately, I cannot raise furry animals due to eczema, but I find joy in taking care of aquatic pets like fish and turtles.
            Ada cerita disebalik nama "Se", dimana saya menamakan se bagi menunjukkan seekor jadi memudahkan saya untuk menamakan ikan saya dengan Se.
            This is the longest fish I have kept. The routine I always do is every 2 weeks, I will clean the aquarium.
            Feed every morning and night.I was very sad when I found out he was gone because this fish was very special to me.

                In my free time, my favorite activity is cycling. I really enjoy cycling because riding a bike increases my stamina. Cycling allows me to explore 
                the green surroundings and the beauty of nature. The place I often cycle is in Putrajaya, which has less traffic compared to Kuala Lumpur, and the flora there is well-maintained.

            Travel is what I like the most. This travel allows us to learn to get to know the culture regardless of whether it is in Malaysia or outside Malaysia.
            An experience that I will never forget is traveling with my partner and going out with my family. A very beautiful memory! From the experience
            this makes me excited to travel within Malaysia and outside Malaysia to explore the beauty of flora and fauna on this earth.
            Among the foreign countries I've been to is traveling in Indonesia. I can feel how the roads are congested on the highway
            Indonesia. Very compact! Unique culture, beautiful shopping places and very tasty food. I like nasi padang
            Indonesia. Then, Universal Studio Singapore. I was able to play various theme parks there. Very best.

                Chess is an activity that is also my hobby. When I was a child I always played with my father and uncle.
                I used to join a chess club because I like playing chess. By joining this chess club
                I can master the skill of playing chess.

        Next, listening to music is also one of my hobbies and usually I will on the songs while doing housework, cleaning, vacuuming and more.
        In addition, listening to music is one of the good therapies because it can relieve stress. I prefer to listen to music in the genres of pop, jazz, R&B and dance pop. 
        I started to like listening to music since my father took me and my family to cafes and held mini concerts. 
        Moreover, I started to like kpop which is a genre of pop music since I heard and saw music videos from girls' generation snsd.
